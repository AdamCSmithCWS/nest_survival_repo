# nest_survival_repo
Project to estimate the effects of numerous factors on the nest survival of arctic nesting shorebirds.

The model is a known-fate model that uses a logistic regression structure to estimate the effect of the number of neighbouring shorebird nests, fox density, lemming density, and other factors on the surival of shorebird nests at the East Bay study site. 

The model is fit in Stan.
